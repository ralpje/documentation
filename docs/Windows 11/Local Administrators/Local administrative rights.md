# Local administrative rights
Previously, some users in the Transavia organization were granted 'local admin rights' on their workplace.

Within Windows 11 and the Cloud Managed Workplace, this will no longer be the case. For all scenario's where LAR's were previously granted, a solution has been put in place to enable the functional requirements, without granting full LAR's. 

!!! Danger
    Trying to grant yourself Local Admin Rights or installing unapproved software on your device is a violation of Transavia policy.
