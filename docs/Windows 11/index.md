# Introduction to Windows 11

The goal of the project is to migrate the workplaces for Transavia to Windows 11. We do this, because Windows 10 will reach [EOS]("End of Support") on a specific date.

Migrating to Windows 11 will improve security and usability and create a feature-proof Workplace for all Transavia employees.
