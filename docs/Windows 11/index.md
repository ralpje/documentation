# Introduction to Windows 11

The goal of the project is to migrate the workplaces for Transavia to Windows 11. We do this, because Windows 10 will reach [EOS]("End of Support") on a specific date.

Migrating to Windows 11 will improve security and usability and create a feature-proof Workplace for all Transavia employees. 

!!! warning "End of Support"
   Windows 10 will reach 'End of Support' by October 14th, 2025. From this date on, no security updates will be released for Windows 10.
