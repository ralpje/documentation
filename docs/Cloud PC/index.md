# Cloud PC

Cloud PC's will be used for 'external hires', that don't have a Transavia supplied device. By using the Cloud PC, we can provide a secure working environment and minimize the risk of data loss. 

??? note
    There are some other scenario's in which a Cloud PC might be used.

## Cloud PC versions
Two versions of the Cloud PC will be available, with small differences in underlying hardware. The Cloud PC available for you will depent on your role within the organization. 

=== "Cloud PC Standard"

    * 2 vCPU's
    * 8GB RAM
    * 128GB SSD Storage

=== "Cloud PC Premium"

    * 4 vCPU's
    * 8GB RAM
    * 128GB SSD Storage

!!! Tip
    You will note the disk size for both versions is the same. This is to allow easy migration of one size to the other. We recommend storing your data in cloud storage (OneDrive, Teams or SharePoint) to save space on your Cloud PC disk.
